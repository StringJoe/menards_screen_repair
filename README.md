# menards_screen_repair
This is an application I made for employees that repair screens at Menard's

After being taught how to repair screens while working at Menard's, I decided to make it easier not only to fill out orders for the customers, but also make it easier to give them the cost of the repair before taxes were involved. 

This application also provides an easier way to calculate what length each piece of frame needs to be cut to when rebuilding screens instead of the employee having to do the math on paper. 

The reason for creating this project was not only to make things easier for the order process, but also to help gain a better understanding of how to create Android apps in general.
